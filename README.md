## Used Patterns
-Generic Repository Pattern
  
      It is a pattern used to avoid code duplication and increase manageability. In our project, a common structure is created
      instead of repeatedly applying the methods that are common to each model. This structure is the 'Generic Repository Pattern'.
      
-Unit Of Work

      It ensures that changes to the database are reflected collectively instead of instantly.
